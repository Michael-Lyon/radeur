# radeur

The project is an ISP ratting system that allows users to rate their network based on their location and also based on the device theyâ€™re using
They can also find networks that work best in their area based on their location.
The location can be gotten by using an api or basically asking them to provide their location and we can later improve to automatically detect their location
They can also comment and reply comments
